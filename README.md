#Excerpt from the introduction

This is meant to be a document teaching supplementary useful mathematics for non mathematical physics students (and those mathematical physics who did not take extra courses). 

There are a lot of topics which are glossed over or simply not covered at all in your average physics curriculum. The mathematics covered in this book will be covered briefly, with as many references to outside literature for further reading as possible. Due to the absolute bucketload of content contained in this book, it will be quite dense. Be prepared to look things up in other books, look for exercises in other books, and look online for guidance. This book is simply meant to familiarize you with important concepts. It is not meant to be a solitary source of knowledge that you can learn everything from.

There will be a few exercises at the end of each chapter which are necessary for understanding the material in this book. Do not skip any of them - they cover topics which are important but often used as homework questions in mathematics courses. If you would like to learn each of these topics properly you need to go study them from full textbooks, otherwise you will get nowhere.

I was inspired to do this because of the amount of discrepancy I saw between students who had a good foundation in "abstract" math and those who only knew what they needed to do calculations. Many people seem almost afraid of learning "abstract" mathematics, because either they believe it's not useful, or they believe it is too hard to be worth the effort. I believe that if people are taught basic definitions and concepts from every applicable area of math, they will experience less math anxiety and feel more motivated to seek out topics in depth. Having a growth mindset is important in every of area life, including learning mathematics. The earlier you familiarize yourself with the concepts of high level math, the easier it will become to learn that math in depth later in your degree.
